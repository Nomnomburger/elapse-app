Multi-purpose VexDB wrapper &amp; scout assistant, written in Flutter

## Uses:
- Scouting
- Keeping track at a tournament
- Local scout database

### Current Features

- Matches tab
  - This will mostly stay the same until v1.0
- Home screen, which displays 6 future tournaments
  - Currently this is broken, due to RobotEvents changing something about their website and breaking [VexDB](https://vexdb.io)'s (the API we currently use) crawlers.
- Settings screen
  - Not much in here, just some info and links

### Planned Features

- A migration to the RobotEvents API when we get a key
- In the far future, our own database which gets data from RobotEvents and provides searching through tournaments to our app
- Team view with a [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editor for taking notes, and the ability to attach images to teams (scouting)
- Indicators on matches that you are participating in
- Website
- Contributing document
